                <!--<h4>All Things JavaScript</h4>
                <p><u>Description</u>:JavaScript is quickly making its way to becoming the most used programming
                        language in the world, so far raking 1st as the most popular in StackOverflow’s
                        developer survey for the 7th year in a row.</p>
                <p>Learn why companies are choosing JavaScript as their technology stack to build
                        applications because it can help them reduce man power, cut back on costs and iterate
                        faster. And on top of it, one other major benefit is that it’s open source and free to use.</p>
                <p>One thing is for sure, JavaScript is here to stay, and I want to make a case to why you
                        would want to learn it. It’s easy to use, fun and nowadays almost everywhere, from web
                        development to mobile and desktop apps and even IoT (Internet of Things).</p> 
                <p>Join us for a three part course on All Things JavaScript :</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li>We’ll talk about how JavaScript can be used to replace traditional programming
                            languages for building different kinds of software applications.</li>
                    <li>Most of today’s apps either mobile, desktop or IoT are connected to some cloud
                            based server for persisting user data or using cloud computing to improve user
                            experience so we have to talk a bit about web development. We’ll see how
                            Internet clients (browsers, mobile/desktop apps) communicate with backend
                            cloud services and how JavaScript fits into the picture.</li>    
                     <li>
                            See it in action. After all this praise it’s time to see some code. We’ll use
                            JavaScript to build a simple notes app that can be deployed to all platforms: web,
                            IOS/Android and desktop (Windows, MacOS and Linux). The app will use a
                            server also built using JavaScript to sync notes across devices.  
                     </li>

                   <h4>Coding Pro-Practices</h4>
                   <p><u>Description</u>: Computers and software are growing and expanding in all of society and life’s
                    aspects, from entertainment, to transport, to health. Hardware has continually
                    experienced massive growth, enabling us to carry almost unfathomable power in our
                    pockets, everywhere we go.</p>
                    <p>
                            Software, however, is not subject to the same leaps in efficiency and performance.
                            Many would argue that the faster hardware gets the lazier developers become and
                            CPU & memory waste becomes more prevalent. We can all think of such a software
                            product. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            This course will take attendees on an explorative journey of problem solving using
                            software. As a programming language we'll be using is C++ 17. This language has a
                            two-fold reputation, on one side for performance and efficiency but on the other for
                            memory management issues and lack of libraries. Programming languages and
                            libraries are only tools, and like all tools, it is up to those using them to do so in an
                            efficient manner, to understand their applicability and limitations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            As proficient as one can get at programming, they will certainly be even better if
                            functioning harmoniously as part of a team. Great software is written by teams.
                            Teams are made of people and people are complicated. We’ll see how teams
                            interact, what the common pitfalls are and learn how to be a better team player.

                            The last day of the course will be a workshop; we'll put to use the concepts explored
                            previously. Our goal will be to arrive at a reliable, fool-resistant long-term solution to a
                            real problem, to code like a pro.

                    <h4>Sneak Peek Into Next Level QA (Test Automation)</h4>
                    <p><u>Description</u>: What should you do, manual testing or automated testing?
                        Which is better? Should you do just one of them? Both ?
                        Let's go through the advantages and disadvantages of both and see.
                    </p>
                    <p>We should start with the most obvious for our users, UI testing (<b> Visual Testing </b>).
                            What? How?
                            Next, let's test the functionality of our webapp/website (<b> E2E Testing or Functional
                            Testing</b> ). Is anything broken after our last patch?
                            </p>
                    <p>Maybe there's a problem with integration between two of our microservices, let's run
                            some tests for that (<b> Integration Testing</b> ), or maybe the problem is with our functions
                            (<b> Unit Testing</b> ). Granularity is the key.
                            </p>
                    <p>
                            Even the most conscientious tester will make mistakes during monotonous manual
                            testing. Automated tests perform the same steps precisely every time they are
                            executed and never forget to record detailed results.
                            FREE yourself from manual testing, and gain more time to create new automated
                            software tests and deal with complex features.

                    <h4>You&apos;ll Neversea Algorithms Like These</h4>
                    <p><u>Description</u>: Is the performance still relevant in these days when the hardware is becoming more
                        and more efficient and the computation costs goes down?</p>
                     <p>
                            Now you can even use computation services without bothering of managing physical
                            hardware, is there any reason why you should think about the performance and
                            efficiency?
                     </p> 
                     <p>
                            I’ll give you two reasons why you should think twice before you’ll choose to
                            implement a naive solution instead of a natural algorithmical approach.

                            Well, let’s try together to get some insights in some algorithms and their application
                            in the real world, how we can solve some challenging tasks and make our lives
                            easier.

                     <h4>Curry on Functional Programming</h4>
                     <p><u>Description</u>: Can a language whose official motto is “Avoid Success at All Costs” teach us new
                        tricks in modern programming languages ?</p>
                        <p>
                                If Haskell is so great, why hasn't it taken over the world? My claim is that it has. But
                                not as a Roman legion loudly marching in a new territory, rather as distributed Trojan
                                horses popping in at the gates, masquerading as modern features or novel ideas in
                                today’s mainstream languages. Functional Programming ideas that have been
                                around for over 40 years will be rediscovered to solve our current software
                                complexity problems. 
                        </p>
                     <p>
                            Indeed, modern programming languages have become more functional. From
                            mundane concepts like lambdas & closures, function objects, values types and
                            constants, to composability of algorithms, ranges, folding, mapping or even
                            higher-order functions.  
                     </p>
                     <p>
                            In this workshop we’ll analyze a bunch of FP techniques and see how they help make
                            our code shorter, clearer and faster, by embracing a declarative vs. an imperative
                            style. Brace yourselves for a bumpy ride including composition, lifting, currying,
                            partial application, pure functions, maybe even pattern matching and lazy evaluation.
